/*
An associative array stores key-value pairs and enable to look for items by their key. The key can be any type of data (strings, integers, etc.)
A hash table implements the concept of associative arrays by using hash functions, i.e., a function that uniformly maps values to integers.

A hash table is basically an array of size n. Storing a key/value in the hashtable consists into computing the hash of the key to get a position in the array: hash(key) % n
Of course, collisions can occurs, i.e., hash(key) % n can give the same index for different keys.

OPEN ADDRESSING
The implementation of this hashtable use "open addressing" for solving the collision problem:
- if a cell of the array is occupied, we look for the first next empty cell to store the key/value pair
- finding a key in the array use the same procedure: hash the key to get a start index, then looking for the key until we find an empty cell

This technique works well as soon as we do not fill the hashtable completely.
If the hashtable become too loaded (e.g., 75% full), we create a bigger array and rehash all elements.

DELETION PROBLEM
With open addressing, deletion can be complex given that creating empty cells will conflict with the search procedure described before.
In this implementation, we use "tombstones". Instead of deleting elements, we only mark them as removed.
- when inserting data, tombstones will be considered like empty cells
- when searching a key, tombstones will be considered as non-empty cells.
As you may imagine, this has an impact on the search performance, requiring us to rehash the whole table when the number of removed items grows

HASHING
The hash function is a very important concept of the hash table.
All good properties of hashtables are based on the fact that the hashfunction must be perfect, i.e., that the function maps values to integers uniformly.
Some hash functions are better at hashing some types than other. In this example we will use a string hash function called DJB2.
