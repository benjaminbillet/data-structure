/*
Binary search assumes that the list is sorted.
This search divides the list in two sublists and look in which sublist lies the element to find.
It then reapply the same process for the sublist.

The search space is divided by two at every iteration, giving us a O(logâ‚‚(n)) = O(log(n)) worst time complexity.

You can implement this algorithm recursively, but the iterative implementation we give here is quite simple.
See links for a recursive implementation.
