/*
Quick sort is also a divide and conquer recursive algorithm. The algorithm pick an element as pivot x and:
- put x at the relevant position
- put all elements < x before x
- put all elements > x after x

The best case occurs when the partition are always balanced (i.e., the pivot is always the median value). This case is equivalent to a merge sort: O(nlog(n))
The worst case of quick sort is O(nÂ²): when the pivot is always the smallest or the biggest element, one partition is always empty.
The average case is also O(nlog(n)), see links for a detailed explanation.

The pivot selection procedure is quite important, we thus introduce a "pivot picker" function.
Tip: given that the algorithm expect to always have the pivot on the right, we swap the modified pivot with the right element.
