/*
The heap sort is similar to the selection sort:
we find the biggest element and put it at the end of the list, we do the same with the second biggest element, and so on.

The main difference is that instead of browsing the whole list, we organize the data in the list to encode a binary heap data structure.
If you are not familiar with this data structure, please first look at the heaps and trees folders.

The heapify function is O(log(n)), given that the height of the heap is logâ‚‚(n) and that our worst case consists into moving an element from the root to the leaf node.
The first and second part of the algorithm are both O(nlog(n)) (heapify is called n times), making an overall complexity of O(nlog(n)) for worst, best and average cases.
