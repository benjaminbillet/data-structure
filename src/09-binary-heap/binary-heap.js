/*
A binary heap is a type of "complete binary tree" that respect the "max-heap" or "min-heap" property:
- a binary tree is called "max-heap" when the value of each node is lesser or equal to the value of its parent
- a binary tree is called "min-heap" when the value of each node is greater or equal to the value of its parent

Given this property, the root is always the greatest or smallest element.
It makes heaps very suitable for implementation of priority queues/stacks, i.e., queues/stacks where push/pop operations are based on priorities associated to every items of the queue.

Regarding time complexity, operations on heaps are similar to operations on well-balanced trees: O(log(n)) for insertion and deletion.


ARRAY ENCODING VS LINKING
This heap implementation specifically demonstrates how a binary tree can be encoded as an array.
It has to be put in contrast to the "linked" binary tree implementation we developped before for the binary search tree and red-black tree.

This encoding states that:
- for a node stored at index i in the array, the left node is located at index 2i+1
- for a node stored at index i in the array, the right node is located at index 2i+2
- thus, given these two properties, the parent of a node at index i is located at index trunc((index - 1) / 2)
Note: there is an alternative encoding that keeps the index 0 of the array empty, such as left(i) = 2i and right(i) = 2i+1

Similarly to an array list, an array-encoded binary heap is resized when the array is full.
